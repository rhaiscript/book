Script Optimization
===================

{{#include ../../links.md}}

Rhai includes an _optimizer_ that tries to optimize a script after parsing.
This can reduce resource utilization and increase execution speed.

Script optimization can be turned off via the [`no_optimize`] feature.


Dead Code Removal
----------------

For example, in the following:

```rust,no_run
{
    let x = 999;            // NOT eliminated: variable may be used later on (perhaps even an 'eval')
    123;                    // eliminated: no effect
    "hello";                // eliminated: no effect
    [1, 2, x, x*2, 5];      // eliminated: no effect
    foo(42);                // NOT eliminated: the function 'foo' may have side-effects
    666                     // NOT eliminated: this is the return value of the block,
                            // and the block is the last one so this is the return value of the whole script
}
```

Rhai attempts to eliminate _dead code_ (i.e. code that does nothing, for example an expression by itself as a statement,
which is allowed in Rhai).

The above script optimizes to:

```rust,no_run
{
    let x = 999;
    foo(42);
    666
}
```


Constants Propagation
--------------------

Constants propagation is used to remove dead code:

```rust,no_run
const ABC = true;

if ABC || some_work() { print("done!"); }   // 'ABC' is constant so it is replaced by 'true'...

if true || some_work() { print("done!"); }  // since '||' short-circuits, 'some_work' is never called

if true { print("done!"); }                 // <- the line above is equivalent to this

print("done!");                             // <- the line above is further simplified to this
                                            //    because the condition is always true
```

These are quite effective for template-based machine-generated scripts where certain constant values
are spliced into the script text in order to turn on/off certain sections.

For fixed script texts, the constant values can be provided in a user-defined [`Scope`] object
to the [`Engine`] for use in compilation and evaluation.

### Caveat

If the [constants] are modified later on (yes, it is possible, via Rust functions),
the modified values will not show up in the optimized script.
Only the initialization values of [constants] are ever retained.

This is almost never a problem because real-world scripts seldom modify a constant,
but the possibility is always there.


Eager Operator Evaluations
-------------------------

Beware, however, that most operators are actually function calls, and those functions can be overridden,
so whether they are optimized away depends on the situation:

* If the operands are not _constant_ values, it is not optimized.

* If the operator is [overloaded][operator overloading], it is not optimized because the overloading function may not be _pure_
  (i.e. may cause side-effects when called).

* If the operator is not _binary_, it is not optimized. Only binary operators are built-in to Rhai.

* If the operands are not of the same type, it is not optimized.

* If the operator is not _built-in_ (see list of [built-in operators]), it is not optimized.

* If the operator is a binary built-in operator for a [standard type][standard types], it is called and replaced by a constant result.

Rhai guarantees that no external function will be run (in order not to trigger side-effects) during the
optimization process (unless the optimization level is set to [`OptimizationLevel::Full`]).

```rust,no_run
// The following is most likely generated by machine.

const DECISION = 1;             // this is an integer, one of the standard types

if DECISION == 1 {              // this is optimized into 'true'
    :
} else if DECISION == 2 {       // this is optimized into 'false'
    :
} else if DECISION == 3 {       // this is optimized into 'false'
    :
} else {
    :
}
```

Because of the eager evaluation of operators for [standard types], many constant expressions will be evaluated
and replaced by the result.

```rust,no_run
let x = (1+2) * 3-4 / 5%6;      // will be replaced by 'let x = 9'

let y = (1 > 2) || (3 < =4);    // will be replaced by 'let y = true'
```

For operators that are not optimized away due to one of the above reasons, the function calls
are simply left behind:

```rust,no_run
// Assume 'new_state' returns some custom type that is NOT one of the standard types.
// Also assume that the '==; operator is defined for that custom type.
const DECISION_1 = new_state(1);
const DECISION_2 = new_state(2);
const DECISION_3 = new_state(3);

if DECISION == 1 {              // NOT optimized away because the operator is not built-in
    :                           // and may cause side-effects if called!
    :
} else if DECISION == 2 {       // same here, NOT optimized away
    :
} else if DECISION == 3 {       // same here, NOT optimized away
    :
} else {
    :
}
```

Alternatively, turn the optimizer to [`OptimizationLevel::Full`].
