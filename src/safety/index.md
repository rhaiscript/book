Safety and Protection Against DOS Attacks
=========================================

{{#title Safety and Protection}}

{{#include ../links.md}}

For scripting systems open to untrusted user-land scripts, it is always best to limit the amount of
resources used by a script so that it does not consume more resources that it is allowed to.

These are common vectors for [Denial of Service (DOS)][DOS] attacks.


Most Important Resources
------------------------

```admonish bug "Memory"
* Continuously grow a [string], an [array], a [BLOB] or [object map] until all memory is consumed.

* Continuously create new [variables] with large data until all memory is consumed.

* Continuously define new [functions] all memory is consumed (e.g. a simple [closure] `||`,
  as short as two characters, is a [function] &ndash; an attractive target for DOS attacks).
```

```admonish bug "CPU"

* Infinite tight loop that consumes all CPU cycles.
```

```admonish bug "Time"

* Run indefinitely, thereby blocking the calling system which is waiting for a result.
```

```admonish bug "Stack"

* Deep recursive call that exhausts the call stack.

* Large [array] or [object map] literal that exhausts the stack during parsing.

* Degenerated deep expression with so many levels that the parser exhausts the call stack when
  parsing the expression; or even deeply-nested statements blocks, if nested deep enough.

* [Self-referencing module][`import`].
```

```admonish bug "Overflows or Underflows"

* Numeric overflows and/or underflows.

* Divide by zero.

* Bad floating-point representations.
```

```admonish bug "Files"

* Continuously [`import`] an external [module] within an infinite loop, thus putting heavy load on the file-system
  (or even the network if the file is not local).

  Even when [modules] are not created from files, they still typically consume a lot of resources to load.
```

```admonish bug "Private data"
* Read from and/or write to private, secret, sensitive data.

  Such security breach may put the entire system at risk.
```

~~~admonish bug "The [`internals`] feature"

The [`internals`] feature allows third-party access to Rust internal data types and functions (for
example, the [`AST`] and related types).

This is usually a _Very Bad Ideaâ„¢_ because:

* Messing up Rhai's internal data structures will easily create panics that bring down the host
  environment, violating the _Don't Panic_ guarantee.

* Allowing access to internal types may open up new attack vectors.

* Internal Rhai types and functions are volatile, so they may change from version to version and
  break code.

Use [`internals`] only if the operating environment has absolutely no safety concerns &ndash; you'd
be surprised under how few scenarios this assumption holds.

One example of such an environment is a Rhai scripting [`Engine`] compiled to [WASM] where the
[`AST`] is further translated to include environment-specific modifications.

_Don't Panic_ Guarantee &ndash; Any Panic is a Bug
--------------------------------------------------

![Don't
Panic](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Don%27t_Panic.svg/320px-Don%27t_Panic.svg.png)

Rhai is designed to not bring down the host system, regardless of what a script may do to it. This
is a central design goal &ndash; Rhai provides a [_Don't
Panic_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Don't_Panic)
guarantee.

When using Rhai, any panic outside of APIs with explicitly documented panic conditions is
considered a bug in Rhai and should be reported as such.

```admonish tip.small "OK, panic anyway"

All these safe-guards can be turned off via the [`unchecked`] feature, which disables all safety
checks (even fatal ones).

This increases script evaluation performance somewhat, but very easy for a malicious script
to bring down the host system.
